# hdc-furahi

Demonstrator of composable FHIR data stack

## About the project name

Furaha describes feelings of happiness and joy. It is used often during happy and joyful ceremonies to encourage the crowd to enjoy themselves. If youâ€™re using it to encourage someone else, the word becomes furahia or furahi, literally translated as 'be happy'. Furahi is also a play on the letters of FHIR.
