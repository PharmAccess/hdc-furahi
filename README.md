# hdc-furahi

Demonstrator of composable FHIR data stack

## About the project name

Furaha describes feelings of happiness and joy. It is used often during happy and joyful ceremonies to encourage the crowd to enjoy themselves. If youâ€™re using it to encourage someone else, the word becomes furahia or furahi, literally translated as 'be happy'. Furahi is also a play on the letters of FHIR.

## Anonimized data set

The dataset for this demonstrator is an anonimized version of mothers in Tanzania. It is based on a maternal care program in Hanang district, Tanzania. As some files exceed the 25 MB limit on GitHub (`Encounter`, `Procedure`, `QuestionnaireResponse`), the full dataset is hosted on google cloud storage as bulk fhir data (ndjson). The url to each file follows the pattern `https://storage.googleapis.com/hanang-anonymized-maternal-care-data/{resourceType}.ndjson`:
