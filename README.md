# hdc-furahi

Demonstrator of composable FHIR data stack

## About the project name

Furaha describes feelings of happiness and joy. It is used often during happy and joyful ceremonies to encourage the crowd to enjoy themselves. If youâ€™re using it to encourage someone else, the word becomes furahia or furahi, literally translated as 'be happy'. Furahi is also a play on the letters of FHIR.

## Anonimized data set

The dataset for this demonstrator is an anonimized version of mothers in Tanzania. It is based on a maternal care program in Hanang district, Tanzania. The dataset was too large to host in github so we uploaded the bulk fhir data to google cloud storage. The data is stored in a bucket called `hanang-anonymized-maternal-care-data`.
